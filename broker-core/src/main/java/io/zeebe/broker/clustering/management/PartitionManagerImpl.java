     * There are some issues with how this connects the gossip state with the system partition processing.
     *
     * * not garbage-free
     * * not thread-safe (peer list is shared state between multiple actors and therefore threads)
     * * not efficient (the stream processor iterates all partitions when it looks for a specific
     *   partition's leader)
     *
     * This code can be refactored in any way when we rewrite gossip.
     * As a baseline, the system stream processor needs to know for a set of partitions
     * if a partition leader becomes known. In that case, it must generate a command on the system log.
